# Hi, I'm Aurora !

I am a third-year BSc student in Mathematics & Computer Science for AI at Università Bocconi in Milan.
I spent my summer as a research intern at the Inria Centre at Côte d’Azur.
My research / academic interests include topology and its applications, applied and computational geometry.

I drink lots of coffee (*you won’t get me to switch to matcha!!*), I love studying early in the morning and taking loooong walks.
